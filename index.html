    <p> <strong>Psalm</strong> </p>
    <p>  <> He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. 
       <br> I will say of the LORD, "He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust. <br>
        " Surely he will save you from the fowler's snare and from the deadly pestilence.<>

     He restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
      <br>Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; 
      <br> your rod and your staff, they comfort me. <br/>
